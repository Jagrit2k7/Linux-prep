I just installed git in my local computer by :
sudo apt install git 

I generated SSH key, and added to my GitHub account , then created a new repository ,
cloned it to my home directory which is /home/name , then i  moved it to Deskptop by mv filename Deskptop/ , then we went to Desktop dir then then to Linux-prep , 
we then created a new first_day txt file , then adding a content in by echo/nano , then saying git so watch that file :
git add first_day.txt
then , git commit - m "First file (any message)"
then push to github : git push
